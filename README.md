Music is power.

### The Goal
- Collect all of the STEMS (colored cubes)
- Destroy the RED CYLINDERS OF EVIL (RCEs) before they get to YOU (in the center)
- Protect the STEMS from the RCEs to win!

### Controls: General
- Press Start or left click to begin the game.
- Press Back or escape to quit on the title screen.
- Press Back or escape to return to the title from the game.

### Controls: Mouse
- Press left click to fire hookshot.
- Hold right click to show aiming reticle.

### Controls: Gamepad (Xbox 360)
- Press A button to fire hookshot.
- Hold either trigger to show aiming reticle.

### Known Bugs
- If you kill an RCE just as it gets a stem (possibly just the last stem) you might not ever see the stem again. Sorry.
- If the hookshot gets stuck in place (either next to you or out in the beyond), sorry - you'll have to restart your game. (This should be fixed but it's a bit sporadic.)
